  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>My name is Erin Miller. I'm a mom and a wife, but I'm also an aspiring web developer. For the first 10 years of my career, 
  I worked in the film industry as a production manager on promos and commercials. Needing a change, I made the switch to working 
  in HR and payroll. Now I'm ready for a new chapter in my career doing something that I actually enjoy doing.</p>
  <p>I love college football (Go Dawgs!), Star Wars, Harry Potter, and ramen.</p>
