<h1>The Best Movies Ever According to Erin</h1>
<h2>My favorite movies...so far</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Raiders of the Lost Ark</h3>
<p>There's nothing not to like about this movie. Action, adventure, romance, John Williams, Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Harrison Ford. You can't convince me there's a better movie out there.</p>
<h3>Jurassic Park</h3>
<p>Dinosaurs. Sam Neill. Jeff Goldblum. Laura freaking Dern. And again, Spielberg and Williams. Say no more.</p>
<h3>When Harry Met Sally</h3>
<p>The chemistry between Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan is incredible. "When you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with someone, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible."</p>
